# üè† David Ferreira - Home Assistant Configuration

<img align="right" src="https://www.home-assistant.io/images/favicon-192x192-full.png">

This is my [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) configuration - based on many of the other great configurations are out there (and listed below)

I live in ![Portugal](http://flags.ox3.in/mini/pt.png) so some of what you find here may not be relevent, or you may have access to better (and probably cheaper) ways.

It's very much a work-in-progress, but feel free to steal ideas or code to use for your own setup

_Please :star: this repo if you find it useful_

## TL;DR

This is my Home Assistant config - documentation isn't my strongest skill, so if you've got any questions, hit me up

<p align="right"><a href="#top" title="Back to top">Top</a></p>

## Ecosystem

My smarthome setup seems to be ever-growing, but at this stage it's unlikely that I'll make any major changes from here

### Hardware

- Dell Optiplex 7060 SFF (i5 8500T, 16Gb RAM, 254Gb HDD) running Proxmox
  - I run three VMs from this machine, one for Home Assistant (Using HassOS) and the other two for other home server stuff

### Zigbee

I'm running a combination of Chinese sensors for doors, Aqara for movement, switchs and modules from several chinese brands and a ZZH as the host in Zigbee2Mqtt
I also use alot of Phlips hue Bulds coneected to a few Hue Bridges
