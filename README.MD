üè†David Ferreira - Home Assistant Configuration


This is my Home Assistant configuration - based on many of the other great configurations are out there (and listed below)

I live in Portugal so some of what you find here may not be relevent, or you may have access to better (and probably cheaper) ways.

It's very much a work-in-progress, but feel free to steal ideas or code to use for your own setup

Please ‚≠ê this repo if you find it useful
