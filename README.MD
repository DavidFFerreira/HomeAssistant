# üè† David Ferreira - Home Assistant Configuration

<img align="right" src="https://www.home-assistant.io/images/favicon-192x192-full.png">

This is my [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) configuration - based on many of the other great configurations are out there (and listed below)

I live in ![Portugal](http://flags.ox3.in/mini/pt.png) so some of what you find here may not be relevent, or you may have access to better (and probably cheaper) ways.

It's very much a work-in-progress, but feel free to steal ideas or code to use for your own setup

_Please :star: this repo if you find it useful_
